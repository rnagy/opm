Create a password protected private key and certificate for the desired users:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 \e
	-subj "/C=HU/ST=*/L=*/O=*/OU=*/CN=Alice/" \e
	-keyout alice.key -out alice.pub
.Ed
.Pp
Optionally one can use an already existing ssh private key to generate a public
certificate:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ openssl req -x509 -new -key ~/.ssh/id_rsa -days 365 \e
	-subj "/C=HU/ST=*/L=*/O=*/OU=*/CN=Alice/" \e
	-out alice.pub

Create a new key pair for signify:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
